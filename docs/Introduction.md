Cytoscape has been a leading platform for visualization and analysis of complex networks that has empowered research since 2003. To complement the highly successful desktop application, we introduce [Cytoscape Web](https://web.cytoscape.org), a web-based version of Cytoscape that supports modern computing environments without the need for software installation.
 
Cytoscape Web delivers efficient network analysis directly in the browser. Its new UI-centric app framework allows for the seamless migration of existing Cytoscape applications and enables *de novo* development of service-based apps in any programming language, thus enhancing access and flexibility.
 
It simplifies data sharing and distribution. Networks can be stored in the [Network Data Exchange (NDEx)](https://www.ndexbio.org) and shared among researchers via unique URLs rather than attaching large session files to email messages.
 
Cytoscape Web expands visualization capabilities by supporting multiple rendering engines, such as the new **Cell View**. Cell View organizes hierarchical networks in a format that mimics the cellular organization, and allows analysis of "communities" of genes using a variety of Large Language Models (LLM) thanks to the [Gene Set AI (GSAI)](https://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/gsai/) service, recently developed by the [Ideker Lab](https://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego and accepted for publication in Nature Methods.
 
By integrating these features, Cytoscape Web not only maintains the robust functionality and familiarity of its desktop counterpart but also enhances collaboration and visual analysis within a modern web environment.
