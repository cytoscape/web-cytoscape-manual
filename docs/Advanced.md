## Extending Cytoscape Web

**Apps** and **Service-Apps** are community built additions that add new functionality to 
Cytoscape Web. 

 Writing an **[App](Advanced#app)** (written in Typescript) gives the developer the
most access to Cytoscape Web APIs and user interface to extend
or augment the interface and analysis tools, but requires comfort
in web development.

The **[Service-Apps](Advanced#service_app)** are more limited in accessibility, but are easier
 to implement and offer freedom of language.

### Service-App

A Service-App is a REST service that can be registered with Cytoscape Web to extend
functionality. For more information about creating a Service-App see:
