## Exporting Networks as Static Images
Cytoscape Web can generate publication-quality images from network views.

To export a network as image, select **Data → Export → Network to Image…**.
The Export Network Image dialog will open and look like the image below:

#### link to image goes here ####

-    You can export the current network view into the following formats: PNG, PDF or SVG

-    The image export dialog has a variable number of options based on the file format selected, with *File Type*, *File Name* and  *Export full network image* always being selectable.
-    The PNG format has also options for scaling and background.
-    PDF has options for paper size.
-    SVG only has a single option, "Export full network image".
-    Once you have selected the appropriate options, click **CONFIRM** in the bottom right corner of the dialog window.
-   Finally, choose the destination folder and save your network's image file.

***NOTE: We recommend using PDF for publications because it is a standard vector graphics format, and it is easy to edit in other applications such as Adobe Illustrator.***
