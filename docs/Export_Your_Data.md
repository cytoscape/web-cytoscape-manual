Export Your Data
====================
<a id="export_your_data"> </a>

### Network
In this version, Cytoscape Web can generate publication-quality images from network views.

To export a network as image, select **Data → Export → Network as Image…** you can export the current network view into the following formats:

JPG

PNG

PS (Post Script)

SVG

PDF

The image export dialog has a variable number of options based on the file format selected, with file type and file name always being selectable. PNG and JPEG have options for scaling, while other formats only have a single option, Export Text as Font. The file name is suggested based on the name of the selected table with the path defaulting to the current working directory. As in raw data export, the suggested file name can be changed using the Browse button or the text field. Press OK to export an image with the given file name and parameters.

We recommend using PDF for publications because it is a standard vector graphics format, and it is easy to edit in other applications such as Adobe Illustrator.
